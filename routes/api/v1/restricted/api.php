Here is where the api could be accessed using authorisation

For example, should there be some app specific info needing to be fetched,
Laravel Passport (more secure than Laravel's out-of-the-box tokens) could be
implimented easily to allow for this, meaning api tokens would be given
ONLY to admin authorised parties.
